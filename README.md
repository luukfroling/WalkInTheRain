# WalkInTheRain

A digital art project written in javascript. The original project was to make a piece of art based on a 'research' on a different piece of art. This project is based on the rainroom. 

I have used p5.js for the webcam functions, and a simple motion tracking algorithm to see where there should not be any rain.
