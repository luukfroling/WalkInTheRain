# WalkInTheRain

A digital art project written in javascript. The original project was to make a piece of art based on a 'research' on a different piece of art. This project is based on the rainroom. 

I have used p5.js for the webcam functions, and a simple motion tracking algorithm to see where there should not be any rain.

Please click on the demo to be redirected to the corresponding github page. The page will ask for camera permission and the project does not work without it.
