# WalkInTheRain

A digital art project written in javascript. The original project was to make a piece of art based on a 'research' on a different piece of art. This project is based on the rainroom. 

I have used p5.js for the webcam functions, and a simple motion tracking algorithm to see where there should not be any rain.

Click below to see the page. The page will request to use your webcam, because it needs video input to detect motion.
The program does not work without camera permissions.
